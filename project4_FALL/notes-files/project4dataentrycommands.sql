# Data entry level user command script
# CNT 4714 - Fall 2023 - Project 4
# This script contains the commands that a cdata-entyr-level user will issue against the
# project3 database (supplier/parts/jobs/shipments).  Due to the restrictions on the data entry level user 
# only inserts are allowed.  Project 4 incoporates server-side 
# business logic that manipulates the status of a supplier when certain conditions involving shipment quantity are triggered.
# This business logic can be impacted by this user.
#
#  Note that this is technically not an SQL script file, but I have shown the corresponding SQL commands in the comments.
